<hr />
<h2>
    <p>Meditation</p>
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Deep into the Force, one must dive. Meditation, the path to clarity and peace, it is.<br />
        Through it, centered I remain, connected to the living Force, I become.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    <p>Lightsaber Practice</p>
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mastery of the blade, crucial it is. In practice, perfection found. Swift, strong, and precise,<br />
        my movements become. Ataru, the form I wield, leaping with the Force, I do.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    <p>Teaching Younglings</p>
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Young minds, bright and full of potential they are. Instruct them, guide them, in the ways<br />
        of the Jedi I must. Patience and wisdom, they learn, as the future of the Order, they become.
    </li>
</ul>
